# LMS__OOPS__Python__Project
## Overview
The Performance Tracker project is a Python-based tool designed to track and analyze student performance. It provides a structured way to add students, record their scores, and evaluate their average performance to determine if they are passing or failing. This tool is useful for teachers, students, or anyone wanting to organize and evaluate academic data.

## Features
Student Data Management: Allows adding student information, including their names and scores for subjects like math, science, and English.

#### Performance Calculation: 
Automatically calculates each student’s average score.

#### Passing Evaluation: 
Determines if each student meets the passing threshold (average score >= 40).
#### Class Performance Analysis: 
Calculates and displays the overall class average for a broader performance overview.
How It Works
#### Adding Students: 
The program prompts the user to enter the number of students. Afterward, the program will request each student’s name and scores.
#### Displaying Performance: 
After entering all student data, the program displays each student’s scores, average score, and whether they are passing.
#### Class Average: 
Finally, the class average is calculated and displayed.
Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Running the Program

Clone or download this repository.

Run the performance_tracker.py script.

Follow the prompts to add student data.

Enter "exit" as a name to stop adding students.

View each student's performance and the class average after input is complete.

## Usage Example

#### Add a Student: 
Input student details and scores.
#### View Performance: 
Check individual and class performance statistics.
## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:

Adding more subjects and customizing passing criteria.

Saving and loading data for persistent student records.

Graphical reports for better visualization of performance data.
